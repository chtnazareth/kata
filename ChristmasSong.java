/**
 * "The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol. A classic example of a cumulative song,
 * the lyrics detail a series of increasingly numerous gifts given to the speaker by their "true love" on each of the
 * twelve days of Christmas (the twelve days that make up the Christmas season, starting with Christmas Day).[1][2]
 * The carol, whose words were first published in England in the late eighteenth century, has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 68.
 * A large number of different melodies have been associated with the song, of which the best known is derived from a 1909 arrangement
 * of a traditional folk melody by English composer Frederic Austin.

/**
 * A cumulative song is a song with a simple verse structure modified by progressive addition so that each verse is longer than the verse before.
 * Cumulative songs are popular for group singing, in part because they require relatively little memorization of lyrics,
 * and because remembering the previous verse to concatenate it to form the current verse can become a kind of game.
