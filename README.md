The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol. A classic example of a cumulative song,
 the lyrics detail a series of increasingly numerous gifts given to the speaker by their "true love" on each of the
 twelve days of Christmas (the twelve days that make up the Christmas season, starting with Christmas Day).[1][2]
 The carol, whose words were first published in England in the late eighteenth century, has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 68.
 A large number of different melodies have been associated with the song, of which the best known is derived from a 1909 arrangement
 of a traditional folk melody by English composer Frederic Austin.

 The song is a cumulative song, meaning that each verse is built on top of the previous verses.
 There are twelve verses, each describing a gift given by "my true love" on one of the twelve days of Christmas.
 There are many variations in the lyrics. The lyrics given here are from Frederic Austin's 1909 publication that first established the current form of the carol.
 The first three verses run, in full, as follows:
 On the first day of Christmas, my true love sent to me
 A partridge in a pear tree.
 On the second day of Christmas, my true love sent to me
 Two turtles doves and a partridge in a pear tree.
 On the third day of Christmas, my true love sent to me
 Three French hens, two turtles doves, and a partridge in a pear tree.

 Christmas Day is the First Day. The Twelve Days are 25 December to 5 January, counting first and last

 A cumulative song is a song with a simple verse structure modified by progressive addition so that each verse is longer than the verse before.
 Cumulative songs are popular for group singing, in part because they require relatively little memorization of lyrics,
 and because remembering the previous verse to concatenate it to form the current verse can become a kind of game.
